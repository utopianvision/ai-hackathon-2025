              "Emily, let's be blunt.  Your resume shows potential, but it's not going to cut it for the most selective colleges on your own.  A 3.9 GPA and a 1480 SAT/33 ACT are good, not great, for the schools you're eyeing.  The admissions committees at places like Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore, etc., see hundreds of applicants with similar scores. You need to *stand out*, not just blend in.\n",

              "\n",
              "* **Academic Record:** While your GPA is solid, it lacks the *rigor* top schools demand.  More AP/IB courses, particularly in STEM, are crucial.  A B+ in Physics and a B in Photography are red flags, suggesting either a lack of focus or a struggle with challenging coursework.  Admissions officers might question your ability to handle the intense academic load at their institutions.\n",
              "\n",
              "* **Extracurriculars:**  \"Member\" is a meaningless term.  Being a member of student council or the newspaper staff doesn't show initiative or leadership.  \"Alternate Captain\" in debate is also weak; you weren't chosen to lead.  These activities lack depth and demonstrate a lack of sustained commitment to any single significant pursuit.  Admissions committees will see a scatter-shot approach, suggesting a lack of focus and passion.\n",
              "\n",
              "* **Leadership:**  Your resume shows almost no evidence of leadership beyond a secondary position on a team.  Top colleges crave demonstrable leadership— leading initiatives, managing projects, influencing peers, etc.  Absence of leadership will seriously hurt your chances.\n",

              "* **Awards:** National Merit Semi-Finalist is good, but it's not a unique achievement.  Many applicants have this.  The Science Olympiad Finalist is better but needs more context – what was your specific role, and did you lead any project? The impact is not clear.\n",
              "\n",
              "* **Community Impact:** 150 community service hours is a decent number, but the activities themselves are generic.  Simply volunteering at a blood drive and food bank won't impress.  They need to be connected to your interests, demonstrate a sustained commitment, and showcase meaningful impact.  Admissions committees look for evidence of genuine passion and initiative.\n",
